## Pod is Pending

The scheduler can't place the pod on any node.

> I see this one more than anything else during practice. 9 times out of 10 it's either a taint without a toleration, or a PVC that isn't bound. `describe pod` tells you which — read the events at the bottom, not the status at the top.

```bash
k describe pod <pod> -n <ns> | grep -A10 Events
```

| Cause | Fix |
|---|---|
| Insufficient CPU/memory | Scale down other pods, add nodes, or reduce resource requests |
| No matching node (nodeSelector/affinity) | Fix nodeSelector labels or add labels to nodes |
| Taint without toleration | Add toleration to pod spec or remove taint from node |
| PVC not bound | Check PVC — storageClassName, accessModes, capacity must match a PV |
| Too many pods (ResourceQuota) | Delete pods or increase quota |

```bash
# Check node resources
k describe nodes | grep -A5 "Allocated resources"

# Check taints
k describe nodes | grep Taints

# Check PVC
k get pvc -n <ns>
```

## Pod is CrashLoopBackOff

The container starts, crashes, restarts, crashes again.

> Exit code 137 (OOMKilled) burned me twice. The pod logs were empty because the process got killed before writing anything. I kept checking the command and image, but the problem was a memory limit too low. `k describe pod` shows `Last State: OOMKilled` — that's the signal. Check `resources.limits.memory` first.

```bash
k logs <pod> -n <ns> --previous    # Logs from the crashed container
k describe pod <pod> -n <ns>       # Exit code in Last State
```

| Exit Code | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Completed (but restartPolicy says restart) | Change restartPolicy or fix command to keep running |
| 1 | Application error | Check logs — wrong config, missing file, bad command |
| 127 | Command not found | Fix `command` or `args` in pod spec |
| 137 | OOMKilled (128 + 9) | Increase memory limit |
| 139 | Segfault (128 + 11) | Application bug or wrong image |

```bash
# Common fixes
k edit pod <pod> -n <ns>       # Fix command/args/env
k set env deployment/<dep> KEY=value  # Fix env vars
k get cm,secret -n <ns>       # Check if ConfigMap/Secret exists
```

---

## Pod is ImagePullBackOff

Kubernetes can't pull the container image.

```bash
k describe pod <pod> -n <ns> | grep -A3 "Warning.*Failed"
```

| Cause | Fix |
|---|---|
| Wrong image name or tag | Fix the image field — check for typos |
| Private registry, no credentials | Add `imagePullSecrets` to pod spec |
| Network issues | Check node internet access, DNS resolution |
| Image doesn't exist | Verify image exists in the registry |

```bash
# Check image
k get pod <pod> -n <ns> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].image}'
```

---

## Node is NotReady

> Every time I see NotReady, I immediately SSH to the node and run `systemctl status kubelet`. In practice exams, it was always one of three things: kubelet stopped, kubelet misconfigured (wrong `--config` path), or certificates expired. `journalctl -u kubelet --no-pager | tail -30` gives you the answer in the first 5 lines.

```bash
k describe node <node> | grep -A5 Conditions
```

| Cause | Fix |
|---|---|
| kubelet not running | `ssh <node>`, then `sudo systemctl start kubelet && sudo systemctl enable kubelet` |
| kubelet misconfigured | `sudo journalctl -u kubelet --no-pager | tail -30` — fix config |
| Expired certificates | `sudo kubeadm certs check-expiration`, then `sudo kubeadm certs renew all` |
| Swap enabled | `sudo swapoff -a` |
| CNI plugin missing | Install CNI (Calico, Flannel) |
| Disk pressure | Free up disk space on the node |

```bash
# On the node
sudo systemctl status kubelet
sudo journalctl -u kubelet --no-pager | tail -50
sudo cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
```

---

## Service Has No Endpoints

Traffic to the service goes nowhere.

> This one is sneaky. The service exists, you can `k get svc` it, but `curl` just hangs. First thing: `k get endpoints <svc> -n <ns>`. If it's empty, the service selector doesn't match any running pod. I spent 10 minutes thinking it was a NetworkPolicy issue before checking endpoints. Now it's the second thing I check after pod status.

```bash
k get endpoints <svc> -n <ns>
# If empty: selector doesn't match any running pod
```

| Cause | Fix |
|---|---|
| Selector doesn't match pod labels | Fix service selector or pod labels |
| Pod not running | Fix the pod first |
| Wrong namespace | Service and pods must be in the same namespace |

```bash
# Compare
k describe svc <svc> -n <ns> | grep Selector
k get pods -n <ns> --show-labels

# Quick fix
k patch svc <svc> -n <ns> -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"app":"correct-label"}}}'
```

---

## Service Reachable but Wrong Response

Endpoints exist but you're getting the wrong content back. This is usually simpler than it looks:\n\n- **targetPort wrong** — `targetPort` in the service doesn't match the port the container actually listens on. Check with `k get svc <svc> -o yaml | grep -A5 ports` and compare.\n- **Wrong pod behind the service** — label collision. You have two deployments with `app: web` and the service is load-balancing across both. Make labels more specific.\n- **Pod is just serving wrong content** — check the pod itself: `k exec <pod> -- wget -qO- localhost:<port>`\n\n```bash\nk get svc <svc> -n <ns> -o yaml | grep -A5 ports\nk exec <pod> -n <ns> -- wget -qO- localhost:<port>\n```

---

## DNS Not Resolving

Pods can't reach services by name.

> My go-to test: `k run test-dns --image=busybox:1.36 --rm -it -- nslookup kubernetes.default`. If that fails, check CoreDNS pods. If CoreDNS is running but DNS still fails, check if a NetworkPolicy is blocking UDP 53 — this got me twice. Also check `resolv.conf` inside the failing pod: `k exec <pod> -- cat /etc/resolv.conf`. If the nameserver IP doesn't match the kube-dns service ClusterIP, something modified the pod's DNS config.

```bash
k run test-dns --image=busybox:1.36 --rm -it -- nslookup kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local
```

| Check | Command |
|---|---|
| CoreDNS running? | `k get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns` |
| CoreDNS has endpoints? | `k get endpoints kube-dns -n kube-system` |
| Corefile correct? | `k get cm coredns -n kube-system -o yaml` |
| Pod DNS config? | `k exec <pod> -- cat /etc/resolv.conf` |

Common fix: restart CoreDNS — `k rollout restart deployment coredns -n kube-system`

---

## NetworkPolicy Blocking Traffic

Traffic was working, now it's not (or vice versa).

> This is the #1 time sink in my practice exams. The moment I see a NetworkPolicy, I check egress DNS first. If egress is restricted and there's no UDP 53 allow, nothing works — not because of the ingress rule, but because DNS resolution fails silently.

```bash
k get netpol -n <ns>
k describe netpol <name> -n <ns>
```

Remember: **any** NetworkPolicy applied to a pod = default deny for that pod. Only explicitly allowed traffic gets through.

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| Pod can't reach anything | Egress policy missing DNS allow (UDP 53) |
| Pod can't be reached | Ingress policy doesn't match source pod labels |
| Works in one namespace, not another | namespaceSelector missing or wrong |

```bash
# Test connectivity
k exec <source-pod> -- wget -qO- --timeout=2 http://<target-svc>

# Check if policy matches the pod
k get pods -n <ns> --show-labels
# Compare labels with netpol podSelector
```

---

## etcd Issues

> The cert flags haunt me. `etcdctl` uses `--cacert`, `--cert`, `--key`. The etcd manifest uses `--trusted-ca-file`, `--cert-file`, `--key-file`. They're different flag names for the same certs. I mixed them up during a practice exam and got a TLS handshake error that told me nothing useful. Now I just grep the etcd manifest for the paths and use the `etcdctl` flag names.

```bash
# Check etcd pod
k get pods -n kube-system | grep etcd
k logs etcd-<node> -n kube-system

# Check etcd health
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl endpoint health \
  --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key
```

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| etcd pod not running | Check `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` for errors |
| Data loss after restore | Did you update both `--data-dir` AND `hostPath.path`? |
| kubectl hangs after restore | Wait 30-60 seconds — etcd is restarting |
| Wrong cert paths | Find them: `cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml | grep -E "cert|key|ca"` |

---

## Control Plane Down

kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, or kube-controller-manager not working.

> When `kubectl` itself stops working, don't panic. It means the API server is down. Go directly to the node, check the static pod manifests in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`. I've seen typos in `kube-apiserver.yaml` (wrong port, wrong cert path) that took down the entire cluster. `crictl pods` and `crictl logs` work even when kubectl doesn't.

```bash
# Check static pod manifests
ls /etc/kubernetes/manifests/

# Check pods
k get pods -n kube-system | grep -E "apiserver|scheduler|controller"

# If kubectl doesn't work, check container runtime directly
sudo crictl pods | grep kube
sudo crictl logs <container-id>
```

| Component Down | Impact |
|---|---|
| kube-apiserver | kubectl doesn't work, no API access |
| kube-scheduler | New pods stay Pending |
| kube-controller-manager | Deployments don't create ReplicaSets, no self-healing |
| etcd | Everything breaks — API server can't store/retrieve data |

Fix: check the manifest YAML in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/` for typos, wrong image, wrong flags, bad volume mounts.

---

## Helm Release Stuck or Failed

> `pending-install` status means the previous install timed out but didn't clean up. I tried `helm upgrade` on a stuck release and it made things worse. Clean way: `helm uninstall <release> -n <ns> --no-hooks`, then reinstall fresh.

```bash
helm list -A
helm status <release> -n <ns>
helm history <release> -n <ns>
```

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Status: pending-install | Previous install timed out — `helm uninstall <release> -n <ns>` then reinstall |
| Status: failed | Check `helm history`, then `helm rollback <release> <revision> -n <ns>` |
| Values wrong after upgrade | Compare with `helm get values <release> -n <ns>`, rerun with correct `-f values.yaml` |
| CRDs not installed | Some charts need `--set installCRDs=true` or a separate CRD manifest first |

```bash
# Force cleanup a stuck release
helm uninstall <release> -n <ns> --no-hooks
```

---

## Gateway API Misconfigured

HTTPRoute exists but traffic does not reach the backend.

> Gateway API errors are silent. The HTTPRoute creates successfully but if `parentRefs.name` doesn't match the Gateway name exactly, traffic just doesn't flow. No error, no warning in events. Check `k get httproute -o yaml` and look at the `status.parents` section — if it shows `Accepted: False`, the parentRef is wrong.

```bash
k get gateway -A
k get httproute -A
k describe httproute <name> -n <ns>
```

| Cause | Fix |
|---|---|
| No GatewayClass installed | Install the controller first (e.g., Envoy Gateway, Istio, Cilium) |
| Gateway not programmed | Check `status.conditions` on the Gateway — look for Accepted/Programmed |
| HTTPRoute parentRef wrong | `parentRefs.name` must match the Gateway name exactly |
| Backend service name wrong | Check `backendRefs` — service name, port, and namespace must be correct |
| Listener port mismatch | HTTPRoute rules must target ports that the Gateway listener actually exposes |

```bash
# Check gateway status
k get gateway <gw> -n <ns> -o yaml | grep -A10 status

# Check httproute status
k get httproute <route> -n <ns> -o yaml | grep -A10 status
```

---

## Native Sidecar Not Starting

Init container with `restartPolicy: Always` does not run as a sidecar.

> I forgot `restartPolicy: Always` on the init container and the pod started normally — the init container ran once and exited. The main container came up but the sidecar was gone. No error. It looked correct until I checked the container list and the sidecar showed `Terminated`. That one field is the entire difference between "init container" and "native sidecar."

```bash
k describe pod <pod> -n <ns>
k get pod <pod> -n <ns> -o yaml | grep -A5 initContainers
```

| Cause | Fix |
|---|---|
| Missing `restartPolicy: Always` on init container | Add `restartPolicy: Always` — without it, it runs as a normal init and exits |
| Sidecar crashing | Check `k logs <pod> -c <sidecar-name>` — bad command or missing volume |
| Feature gate not enabled (older cluster) | Native sidecars are GA in v1.35, but older clusters need the SidecarContainers gate |
| Volume not shared | Both sidecar and main container must mount the same volume name |

---

## kubectl debug Not Working

```bash
k debug node/<node> -it --image=busybox:1.36
k debug pod/<pod> -it --image=busybox:1.36 --target=<container>
```

| Cause | Fix |
|---|---|
| Permission denied on node debug | You need cluster-admin or equivalent RBAC for node debug |
| Ephemeral container not attaching | Check if the pod supports ephemeral containers (most do in v1.35) |
| Can't see target container filesystem | Use `--target=<container>` to share process namespace |
| Node debug pod stuck | The debug pod mounts the node filesystem at `/host` — use `chroot /host` |

---

## CSI Volume Mount Failure

Pod stuck in `ContainerCreating` with volume-related events.

> `ContainerCreating` for more than 30 seconds usually means a volume problem. I spent 5 minutes checking the pod spec when the real issue was the CSI driver wasn't installed. `k get csidrivers` — if it's empty, that's your answer. Also check the PVC events separately: `k describe pvc <name>` sometimes shows errors the pod events don't.

```bash
k describe pod <pod> -n <ns> | grep -A5 "Warning.*FailedMount"
k get pvc -n <ns>
k get pv
k get csidrivers
```

| Cause | Fix |
|---|---|
| CSI driver not installed | Install it — check `k get csidrivers` |
| StorageClass provisioner wrong | Must match an installed CSI driver name |
| PVC stuck in Pending | Check events on the PVC itself: `k describe pvc <name> -n <ns>` |
| Node can't attach volume | Check kubelet logs on the node where the pod is scheduled |
| Volume already attached to another node | AccessMode conflict — use ReadWriteMany or ensure the old pod is gone |

---

## Kustomize Apply Not Working

Run `k kustomize <directory>/` first to see the rendered output. If that looks wrong, the problem is in kustomization.yaml. If it looks right but `k apply -k` fails, it's usually a namespace or resource conflict.\n\nMost common cause: paths in kustomization.yaml are relative to where the file is, not where you're running the command from. I got bitten by this in exercise 14.\n\n```bash\nk kustomize <directory>/ | less    # preview before applying\nk apply -k <directory>/\n```

---

## Quick Diagnostic Commands
